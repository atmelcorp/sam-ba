# Microchip SAM-BA - SAM Boot Assistant

## Version 3.3.1

#### Bugfixes

- Added a work-around in 'secure' port to deal with missing USB Zero Length
  Packets in the USB device stack of SAMA5 ROM codes.
- Fixed the decoding of the Boot Configuration word on SAMA5D2 devices when
  when the 'SIGN_MODE_RSA' bit is set. This bug affected the 'readcfg' and
  'writecfg' commands of the 'bootconfig' applet.
- Fixed typos in the HTML documentation.

#### Enhancements

- Added a new multi_sam-ba.py script to spawn many instances of sam-ba in order
  to program as many target devices in parallel through USB connections.
  Known limitation: not yet compatible with the '-x' option that executes a QML
  script.
- Added a new 'pairingmode' applet for SAMA5D2 and SAM9X60 devices:
  this 'pairingmode' applet translates a boostrap 'master' image file, ciphered
  and signed  with secure-sam-ba-cipher.py, into a bootstrap 'paired' image
  file, still ciphered and signed but now using a secret key that is unique to
  each device.
- Added a new '-w' command line option to change the current working directory
  before executing the QML script provided to the '-x' option.
- Added Getting Started HTML pages for SAMA5D3 and SAMA5D4 devices.
- Documented the secure boot mode on SAMA5D3 on SAMA5D4 devices.
- Added a "TIMEOUT" debug message in the SecureConnection port.
- Limited verbosity of debug messages in the SecureConnection port when the
  trace level is set to 2. The new level 3 now displays debug messages as the
  former level 2 did.
- Updated presets in the HTML page documenting the 'extram' applet.

#### API Changes

- Added a new board file for SAMA5D27-WLSOM1-EK boards: '-b sama5d27-wlsom1-ek'
  option.
- Added a new board file for SAMA5D2-ICP boards: '-b sama5d2-icp' option.
  The Winbond W632GU6MB DDR3 chip is not supported yet by the 'extram' applet.



## Version 3.3

#### Bugfixes

#### Enhancements

- Rebuilt all applets from softpack v2.17.
- Kept on improving the HTML and command line documentation.
- Added Getting Started HTML pages for SAMA5D2 and SAM9X60 devices.
- Documented the secure boot mode on SAMA5D2 and SAM9X60 devices.
- Added a new 'ReadUniqueId' applet to read the device unique ID.

#### API Changes

- No changes were made to the QML API



## Version 3.3-beta2

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the 'writeboot' command when using the 'secure' port

#### Enhancements

- Updated all applets on SAM9X60 so they are linked to be run in internal SRAM0
  instead of external RAM (ROM code v1.1 and later).
- Modified command line parser to require either -d or -b option with -a and -m
  options to allow different help messages to be displayed depending on the
  device familly.
- Extended 'secure' port with device specific monitor commands for SAMA5D2 and
  SAM9X60.

#### API Changes

- Merged the SecureBootConfigApplet into the BootConfigApplet



## Version 3.3-beta1

- Added the new SecureConnection class to handle connections to the secure
  SAM-BA monitor



## Version 3.2.3

### Bugfixes

- Fixed 'extram' applet so the 'preset' parameter can be set from the command
  line.
- Added missing JLinkARM.dll file in win32 archive.

### API Changes

- No changes were made to the QML API



## Version 3.2.2

### Bugfixes

- Fixed applets not working on board designs without external MAIN crystal.
- Fixed J-LINK selection by serial number.
- Fixed J-LINK connections on SAM9XX5.
- Fixed *sleep() issue on SAMA5D31 where applets tried using the non-existing
  TC1.
- Added new 'internalrc' applet on SAMA5D2 to force the use of the 12MHz
  internal RC instead of the external MAIN crystal (Needed before programming
  fuses on SAMA5D27 SOM).
- Added new 'enablebootpartition' command to 'sdmmc' applet to enable/disable
  eMMC boot partitions.

### Enhancements

- All applets rebuilt using softpack 2.13 + few additional patches. This brings
  support for more SPI/QSPI NOR memories.
- Allow to change the speed of J-Link connections.
- Added new 'reset' applet.
- Added new 'enablebootpartition' command to 'sdmmc' applet.
- Added new 'tag' and 'untag' commands to 'nandflash' applet to set/clear bad
  block marks.

### API Changes

- SAM-BA now requires J-LINK SDK V6* to build.
- Extracted the source code for X-Modem support from the serial connection
  plugin to a dedicated shared library.
- Reworked the interface and methods of the Connection class to better abstract
  the sequence of operations executed by the Connection::appletExecute() method.



## Version 3.2.1

### Bugfixes

- Fixed NAND header value for SAM9xx5EK.
- Fixed parsing of numeric arguments to writecfg commands to BootConfig applet.
- Fixed SAMA5D2 fuse boot configuration example to disable BSCR/BUREG

### Enhancements

- All applets rebuilt using softpack 2.10.  This brings support for non-ONFI
  NAND memories and more SPI/QSPI NOR memories using SFDP.
- Applet trace level can be set from command-line (-t, --trace) or QML
  (Script.traceLevel).
- New Fuse example for SAMA5D2

### API Changes

- Internal shared library sambacommand was removed



## Version 3.2.0

### Bugfixes

- Fixed bug when loading applets on Windows when SAM-BA path contains spaces
- Fixed bug with USB on Windows 10

### Enhancements

- Provide applets for initializing external RAM on all devices.
- All applets rebuilded using latest code from softpack.
- Build with Qt 5.9.0
- Implemented XMODEM support (allows programming using SAM-BA Monitor protocol
  over UART)
- Added support for SD/MMC and e.MMC for SAM9xx5, SAMA5D3 and SAMA5D4
- Board-specific configurations are now in separate QML files, one per board.
- Serial peripheral and pin used for applet traces is now configurable via the
  board configuration and as arguments to the device/board command line
  parameter.
- SAMV71 device family support was completely reworked. It now uses 3.x applets
  from the software package like the other devices.
- J-Link driver now supports SAMV71 device family (E70/S70/V70/V71)
- Added support for new boards sama5d27-som1-ek and sama5d2-ptc-ek.

### API Changes

- SAM-BA now requires Qt 5.9 to build
- SAM-BA QML API modules version is now 3.2
- Some common QML code is shared between similar applets for different devices
- Applet configuration parameters in the device object are now split by applet
  (config.serialflash, config.sdmmc, etc.)
- Board selection is not done using a 'board' property on the device anymore.
  Instead, the boards are defined using inheritance: for example, the
  SAMA5D2Xplained QML object inherits from SAMA5D2 QML object.
- Removed AppletLoader object. Connection object can now be used directly when
  working with applets.



## Version 3.1.4

### Enhancements

- Support for SAM9xx5 (NAND Flash and SPI Flash)
- Add command-line support for 'read', 'write' and 'execute' monitor commands
- Add command-line support for 'fullerase' (SAMV7)
- NAND: retrieve and display NAND header value from applet

Several small changes where made to the QML API, please see the provided examples.
Notable changes:
- SAM-BA QML API modules version is 3.1
- configuration declaration for SAMA5D2 is less verbose. Default for the
  SAMA5D2 device is to be unconfigured, but the "sama5d2-xplained" board
  property can be set to get the same configuration as previous version.
- boot configuration on the SAMA5D2 now uses an applet and a different syntax.
